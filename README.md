# AWS Explorer

Discover, monitor, and display AWS resources across accounts and regions via CLI or TUI.

## Features

- **Four modes**: CLI (streaming table/JSON output), TUI (interactive exploration), VPC Explorer TUI (drill into a VPC's networking), S3 TUI (dedicated S3 browser)
- **15 services**: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, DynamoDB, Lambda, EMR, ECS, EKS, ELBv2, Secrets Manager, SQS, SNS, CloudWatch, Route53
- **VPC Explorer**: browse a VPC's subnets, security groups, network interfaces, route tables, gateways, endpoints, NACLs, peering, flow logs, and attached compute/services in a three-pane TUI
- **VPC debugging toolkit** (no AI, deterministic): a findings linter, a connectivity path tracer, plain-English SG/NACL rule explanations, cross-reference ("where used"), merged effective security rules, DNS diagnostics, a public-exposure audit, snapshot diffing, Markdown export, and AWS Reachability Analyzer integration — see [VPC Debugging Toolkit](#vpc-debugging-toolkit)
- **Config-driven**: YAML configuration for services, regions, filters, output, and per-resource display columns
- **5 auth methods**: auto (SDK default chain), profile, env vars, static credentials, STS AssumeRole
- **Output formats**: Table (default), JSON
- **Filtering**: By region, state, tags, name, and IDs
- **Concurrent**: Bounded goroutine pool (default 8) for parallel collection across services and regions
- **Themes**: 12 built-in bird-themed color schemes with 24 individually customizable color roles (table header, borders, status bar, alerts, …) — editable live in the in-app settings panel
- **Context-aware shortcuts**: the status bar in every TUI shows only the keys that work on the current screen
- **Uniform tables**: every table shares one theme and scrolls horizontally (`<` / `>`) when columns don't fit

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26.1 or later
- AWS credentials configured (see [Authentication](#authentication))

## Quick Start

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ryandam9/aws_explorer.git
cd aws_explorer
make build          # produces bin/aws_explorer

# Run CLI (streams table to stdout)
./bin/aws_explorer

# Run interactive TUI
./bin/aws_explorer tui

# List every resource across all regions (SNO, Name, Type, ARN, Region/AZ)
./bin/aws_explorer summary --all-regions

# Run the VPC Explorer TUI

```

## Build

```bash
# Build binary
make build
# or
go build -o bin/aws_explorer main.go

# Format, vet, test, and build
make all

# Run tests
make test

# Tidy modules
make tidy

# Lint (requires golangci-lint)
make lint

# Clean binary
make clean
```

## CLI Usage

The default command streams discovered resources as a table or JSON to stdout.

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config` | `config.yaml` | Path to config file |
| `--profile` | `default` | AWS named profile |
| `--auth-method` | `auto` | Auth method: `auto`, `profile`, `env`, `static`, `sts` |
| `--role-arn` | — | IAM role ARN to assume (for `sts` auth) |
| `--output` | `table` | Output format: `table` or `json` |
| `--all-regions` | `false` | Scan all available AWS regions |

### Examples

```bash
# Use a named AWS profile
./bin/aws_explorer --profile prod

# Output JSON
./bin/aws_explorer --output json

# Scan all regions
./bin/aws_explorer --all-regions

# Assume an IAM role
./bin/aws_explorer --auth-method sts --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole

# Custom config file
./bin/aws_explorer --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Combine flags
./bin/aws_explorer --profile dev --output json --all-regions
```

## TUI Usage

Interactive terminal UI with sidebar navigation, resource table, and detail panel.

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer tui [flags]
```

Accepts the same `--config`, `--profile`, `--auth-method`, `--role-arn`, and `--all-regions` flags as the CLI command.

### TUI Keyboard Shortcuts

The status bar at the bottom is **context-aware**: it lists only the shortcuts
that are usable on the current screen (and with the current panel focus), so
what you see in the bar is always what works right now.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` / `j` / `k` | Navigate rows |
| `[` / `]` | Move through the service sidebar / scroll the detail panel |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Switch focus between sidebar, table and detail panel |
| `<` / `>` (or `,` / `.`) | Scroll table columns when the table is wider than the panel |
| `Enter` | Select service / open the detail panel for the selected resource |
| `/` | Quick text filter (matches any column) |
| `f` | Advanced filter (region / state) |
| `r` | Reset all filters |
| `S` | Settings panel (themes & colors) |
| `?` | Help overlay |
| `Esc` | Close detail panel / overlay |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Summary Usage

`summary` produces a single, numbered inventory of **every** discovered resource
across all configured regions. Each row carries five columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SNO` | Serial number (1-based, assigned after sorting) |
| `NAME` | Resource name (bucket name, EC2 `Name` tag, VPC name, …) or `-` when none |
| `TYPE` | Resource type as `service/type` (e.g. `ec2/instance`, `s3/bucket`) |
| `ARN` | Full ARN — returned by AWS where available, otherwise constructed |
| `REGION/AZ` | Region, plus the availability zone for zonal resources (e.g. `us-east-1 / us-east-1a`) |

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer summary [flags]
```

Accepts the same `--config`, `--profile`, `--auth-method`, `--role-arn`, and
`--all-regions` flags as the CLI command.

### Summary Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--output` / `-o` | `table` | Output format: `table`, `json`, or `csv` |
| `--tui` | `false` | Explore the same inventory interactively instead of printing |

### Examples

```bash
# Table of every resource in every region
./bin/aws_explorer summary --all-regions

# Export the inventory as CSV
./bin/aws_explorer summary --all-regions -o csv > inventory.csv

# As JSON
./bin/aws_explorer summary -o json

# Explore interactively
./bin/aws_explorer summary --tui
```

> Constructing ARNs for resources AWS doesn't return them for (EC2, S3, SQS, …)
> requires the account ID, which is resolved once via `sts:GetCallerIdentity`.
> If that call is denied, those ARNs are shown as `-` while AWS-provided ARNs
> still appear.

## VPC Explorer TUI Usage

An interactive, three-pane TUI for drilling into a single VPC's networking and
attached resources. Pick a VPC on the left, a resource category in the middle,
and browse the matching resources on the right.

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer vpc [flags]
```

If `--region` is omitted, all regions are scanned for VPCs.

### VPC Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--profile` | (global) | AWS named profile (overrides global `--profile`) |
| `--auth-method` | (global) | Auth method: `auto`, `profile`, `env`, `static`, `sts` |
| `--role-arn` | — | IAM role ARN to assume via STS |
| `--region` | — | AWS region (defaults to all regions if omitted) |
| `--theme` | `spotted-pardalote` | Color theme |
| `--all-regions` | `false` | Scan all AWS regions |

### Layout

```
┌─ VPCs ──────┬─ Resources ─────┬─ Subnets ─────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Resource categories

The middle pane groups the resource types a VPC contains. Selecting one (with
`Enter`) loads it into the right-hand table.

- **NETWORK** — Subnets, Security Groups, **Network Interfaces** (ENIs), Route Tables, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, VPC Endpoints, Network ACLs, Peering, Flow Logs
- **COMPUTE** — EC2 Instances, Lambda Functions
- **SERVICES** — RDS Instances, Load Balancers

Each table shows a default set of columns; the full attribute set (plus tags,
rule lists, etc.) appears in the **detail overlay** when you press `Enter` on a
row. Which columns and detail fields are shown can be overridden per resource
type in `config.yaml` — see [Customizing displayed columns](#customizing-displayed-columns).

### Keyboard shortcuts

**Navigation**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` / `j` / `k` | Move within the VPC list, category sidebar, or resource table |
| `Enter` | Open a VPC · load a category · open the selected row's detail overlay |
| `Tab` | Switch focus between the category sidebar and the resource table |
| `<` / `>` (or `,` / `.`) | Scroll table columns left/right when a table is wider than the panel |
| `/` | Filter the VPC list by name or ID (VPC list only) |
| `c` | Copy the selected resource's ID to the clipboard |
| `r` | Refresh the VPC list or the current resource list |
| `Esc` | Go back one level (overlay → table → sidebar → VPC list) |
| `S` | Open the settings panel (themes & colors) |
| `?` | Toggle the help overlay |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

**Debugging toolkit** (available in the resource browser)

| Key | Action | Cost |
|-----|--------|------|
| `F` | **Findings** — run the VPC linter and list ranked issues | free |
| `t` | **Trace** — connectivity path tracer from the selected network interface | free |
| `x` | **Where used** — cross-reference the selected resource | free |
| `e` | **Effective rules** — merged security-group rules for the selected ENI | free |
| `D` | **DNS** — the VPC's DNS resolution / hostnames / DHCP options | free |
| `P` | **Public exposure** — everything reachable from the internet | free |
| `w` | **What changed** — baseline the VPC, then diff against it later | free |
| `E` | **Export** — write a Markdown report of resources + findings | free |
| `A` | **Reachability Analyzer** — list AWS Network Insights analyses; create new ones | listing free; creating ~$0.10/analysis |

Inside any overlay, `↑` / `↓` scroll and `Esc` (or the same trigger key) closes it.

### Horizontal column scrolling

Wide tables (e.g. Security Groups, with ~106 columns of data) don't truncate or
drop columns on narrow terminals. The leading identifier columns stay **pinned**
while the remaining columns scroll with `<` / `>`; a `◀ N more cols ▶` indicator
shows when columns are hidden off either edge, and the status bar advertises
`</>` only while there is something to scroll to. This works the same in every
table of the application — the summary TUI, the S3 browser and the VPC
explorer.

---

## VPC Debugging Toolkit

The VPC Explorer is built for the questions a cloud/support engineer actually
asks. Every analysis below is **deterministic** — computed locally from the
resources AWS returns, with no AI — and the one feature that can change anything
in AWS (`A`) is read-only by default and asks for confirmation before any paid
call. Most overlays fetch a one-shot *snapshot* of the VPC's networking
(subnets, security groups, ENIs, route tables, gateways, NACLs, peerings,
endpoints) and reason over it.

### Plain-English rule explanations

Opening the detail overlay (`Enter`) for a **Security Group** or **Network ACL**
adds an "In plain English" section that translates each rule into a readable
sentence:

```
  In plain English:
  • Allow inbound HTTPS (TCP 443) from anywhere on the internet (0.0.0.0/0)
  • Allow inbound SSH (TCP 22) from anywhere on the internet (0.0.0.0/0)  ⚠ remote admin access open to the entire internet
  • Allow inbound MySQL/Aurora (TCP 3306) from resources in security group sg-0abc123
```

- **Ports** are named from a table of ~60 well-known services (22→SSH, 443→HTTPS, 3306→MySQL/Aurora, 5432→PostgreSQL, 6379→Redis, 3389→RDP, …).
- **Sources/destinations** are classified: public (`0.0.0.0/0`), IPv6 (`::/0`), single host (`/32`), RFC1918 private networks, security-group references (`sg-…`), and prefix lists (`pl-…`).
- **Risk flags (`⚠`)** are added only for genuinely dangerous exposure to the public internet — remote-admin ports (SSH/RDP/VNC/Telnet), database/cache ports, all-ports/all-traffic, or a port range spanning sensitive ports. Ordinary public web ports (HTTP/HTTPS) are intentionally **not** flagged, to avoid alert fatigue.
- **NACL** explanations additionally show the rule number and allow/deny action, label the catch-all as `Rule * (default)`, and note that NACLs are **stateless** and evaluated in ascending rule-number order (first match wins).

### Findings linter (`F`)

Scans the whole VPC and opens a scrollable, severity-grouped list of issues
(`🔴 critical`, `🟡 warning`, `🔵 info`), sorted most-severe first:

```
VPC Findings — 1 critical, 2 warning, 0 info

🔴 CRITICAL  Security group exposes a sensitive port to the internet  [sg-0a1]
   sg-0a1 (default): Allow inbound SSH (TCP 22) from anywhere on the internet (0.0.0.0/0)
   Fix: Restrict the source to specific CIDRs or a security group instead of 0.0.0.0/0.
```

Each finding has a **title**, the **resource** it concerns, a **detail** of why
it fired, and a suggested **fix**. The checks:

| Area | Finding | Severity |
|------|---------|----------|
| Security groups | Sensitive port (admin/database/all) open to `0.0.0.0/0` | 🔴 critical |
| Security groups | Rule references a security group not in this VPC | 🔵 info |
| Route tables | Blackhole route (target deleted) | 🟡 warning |
| Subnets | Low available IPs / >90% utilization | 🟡 warning |
| Subnets | Auto-assign public IP but no internet-gateway route | 🟡 warning |
| Subnets | No outbound internet path (no IGW/NAT route) | 🔵 info |
| NAT gateways | Available but unreferenced by any route (idle, still billing) | 🟡 warning |
| Internet gateways | Detached from the VPC | 🔵 info |
| Network ACLs | Stateless return-traffic gap (ephemeral ports not allowed back) | 🟡 warning |
| Peering | Overlapping CIDRs · not active | 🟡 / 🔵 |
| VPC endpoints | Gateway endpoint with no route-table association | 🟡 warning |
| VPC endpoints | Interface endpoint SGs don't allow inbound 443 · private DNS off | 🟡 / 🔵 |
| **Capacity** | Rules per SG (limit 60), routes per route table (50), SGs per ENI (5), subnets per VPC (200) | 🟡 ≥80%, 🔴 at limit |
| **Orphans** | Security group attached to nothing & unreferenced · empty subnet | 🔵 info |

The NACL stateless check is careful to *not* flag the correct "inbound 443 +
outbound ephemeral" pattern. Capacity limits are AWS defaults (adjustable via
Service Quotas). Orphan checks are skipped if ENI data is unavailable.

### Connectivity path tracer (`t`)

The "can't connect" doctor. From a selected **Network Interface**, press `t` and
enter a destination as `IP[:port]` (or `internet:443`). It walks the path the
way AWS evaluates it and reports the **first hop that blocks** the connection:

```
❌ Blocked at: Destination security group ingress

• Source                              eni-web (10.0.0.10) in subnet subnet-pub
✓ Security group egress               sg-web allows all traffic
✓ Source NACL egress                  acl-default rule 100 allows it
✓ Route table                         10.0.0.0/16 → local (local)
✓ Destination NACL ingress            acl-default rule 100 allows it
✗ Destination security group ingress  no ingress rule on sg-db allows TCP 5432 from 10.0.0.10
```

It evaluates, in order: source security-group **egress** (stateful) → source
NACL **egress** (stateless, ordered, first-match-wins) → **route-table**
longest-prefix lookup (local / IGW / NAT / blackhole) → for in-VPC
destinations, the destination NACL **ingress** and security-group **ingress**
(resolving `sg-` references against the peer ENI) → and the **stateless return
path** (ephemeral ports 1024–65535). Internet via an internet gateway requires
the source to hold a public IP/EIP; via a NAT gateway it's treated as private
egress.

### Cross-reference — "where used" (`x`)

On any resource, `x` shows everything that references it and what it
references, turning the flat tables into a navigable graph:

```
Where used: subnet-priv
Route table  (1)                    • rtb-priv
Network ACL  (1)                    • acl-priv
Network interfaces in subnet  (1)   • eni-b
```

Covered: **security groups** (attached ENIs + their instances, and other SGs
referencing them), **subnets** (route table & NACL — including the implicit
main/default when unassociated — plus ENIs and NAT gateways), **route tables**
(associated subnets and non-local targets), **network interfaces**
(instance/subnet/SGs), **NAT & internet gateways** (route tables routing to
them), and **network ACLs** (associated subnets).

### Effective security rules (`e`)

An ENI can carry several security groups, and AWS evaluates the **union** of
their rules. On a Network Interface, `e` shows the merged, de-duplicated
inbound/outbound rules in plain English, annotated with the contributing
group(s):

```
Effective rules: eni-app
Security groups: sg-a, sg-b

Inbound  (3)
  • Allow inbound HTTPS (TCP 443) from anywhere on the internet (0.0.0.0/0)
      via sg-a, sg-b          ← identical rule in both groups, collapsed
Network ACL acl-1 also applies to this subnet (stateless, evaluated separately).
```

### DNS & VPC attributes (`D`)

For the "DNS doesn't resolve in my VPC" case. Shows the attributes plus
diagnostic notes:

```
DNS resolution        Enabled
DNS hostnames         Disabled
DHCP options set      dopt-abc
Domain name servers   10.0.0.2, 8.8.8.8
Domain name           corp.internal

Notes
  🟡 DNS hostnames disabled — interface VPC endpoints' private DNS will not resolve.
  • Custom DNS servers bypass the Amazon Route 53 Resolver; private hosted zones /
    endpoint private DNS may not resolve unless those servers forward to it.
```

`enableDnsSupport` off is flagged critical, `enableDnsHostnames` off is a
warning, and custom DHCP DNS servers are noted as info.

### Public exposure (`P`)

A one-screen audit of the VPC's internet-facing surface:

```
Public exposure — internet-facing surface
Public subnets (route to an internet gateway)                    (1)  • subnet-pub
Security groups open to the internet (inbound from 0.0.0.0/0)    (1)  • sg-web (web) — HTTPS (TCP 443)
Network interfaces with a public IP                              (1)  • eni-pub (52.1.1.1) → i-web
```

Public subnets are those routing to an internet gateway; SGs list their
internet-open ports in plain English (SG-to-SG references excluded); ENIs are
those holding a public IP/EIP.

### Snapshot diff — "what changed" (`w`)

For "it worked yesterday". The first `w` on a VPC saves a baseline snapshot;
later, `w` diffs the live VPC against it and shows exactly what changed —
added/removed resources and, for resources that still exist, the specific facts
(rules, routes, attributes) that were added or removed:

```
Changes since baseline — 1 added, 1 removed, 1 modified
+ Security group sg-new
- Security group sg-old
~ Security group sg-web
    + inbound|tcp|22|10.0.0.0/8
```

Baselines are stored as JSON in `~/.aws_explorer/vpc-snapshots/<vpc-id>.json`.
Inside the overlay, `b` re-baselines to the current state. Volatile fields (like
available-IP counts) are deliberately excluded so they don't create noise.

### Markdown export (`E`)

Writes a self-contained Markdown report — a resource-count summary, all findings
grouped by severity with fixes, and inventory tables (subnets, security groups,
route tables, NAT gateways, endpoints, network interfaces) — to
`~/.aws_explorer/exports/<vpc-id>-<timestamp>.md`. Ideal for pasting into a
support case or runbook. The status bar shows the path.

### AWS Reachability Analyzer (`A`)

Integrates the authoritative AWS [Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html).
**Read-only by default** — `A` lists the Network Insights analyses that already
exist in the account, each as `source → destination:port` with a
`reachable` / `not reachable` / `running` / `failed` verdict:

```
Reachability Analyzer
✓ eni-web → eni-db:3306 (tcp)  [reachable]       2026-06-09 10:00
✗ eni-web → igw-1 (tcp)  [not reachable]         2026-06-09 11:30
```

Creating a new analysis is **opt-in**: press `n`, enter
`source -> destination[:port]` (prefilled with the selected network interface),
then confirm a prompt that **states the cost** before anything is created:

```
⚠ This creates AWS resources and incurs a per-analysis charge (~$0.10).
  eni-web → eni-db:3306
y = create and run  •  n/Esc = cancel
```

On confirmation it creates a Network Insights path, starts the analysis, polls
until it completes (up to ~2 minutes), and prepends the result. This is the only
VPC Explorer feature that mutates AWS or incurs a charge.

> **Files written by the toolkit.** Snapshots: `~/.aws_explorer/vpc-snapshots/`.
> Exports: `~/.aws_explorer/exports/`. Both directories are created on demand.
> All other features are purely in-memory.

## S3 TUI Usage

A dedicated S3 browser with bucket listing, object navigation, metadata viewing, and optional delete support.

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer s3 [flags]
```

### S3 Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--bucket` | — | Bucket name to open directly |
| `--prefix` | — | Key prefix to start browsing from |
| `--region` | — | AWS region of the bucket |
| `--theme` | `spotted-pardalote` | UI theme name |
| `--allow-delete` | `false` | Enable object deletion |
| `--endpoint-url` | — | Custom endpoint (LocalStack, MinIO, etc.) |

### S3 Examples

```bash
# Browse all buckets
./bin/aws_explorer s3

# Open a specific bucket
./bin/aws_explorer s3 --bucket my-bucket --region us-east-1

# Browse with a prefix filter
./bin/aws_explorer s3 --bucket my-bucket --prefix logs/2024/

# Use a different theme
./bin/aws_explorer s3 --theme oriole

# Enable deletion (use with caution)
./bin/aws_explorer s3 --bucket my-bucket --allow-delete

# Point to a local MinIO or LocalStack instance
./bin/aws_explorer s3 --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000
```

## Makefile Targets

```bash
make build           # Build binary to bin/aws_explorer
make run             # Build and run CLI mode

### Customizing displayed columns

The VPC Explorer ships sensible default columns for each resource type, but you
can override which fields appear as table `columns` and which appear in the
`detail` overlay under `display.vpc.<resource>`. Resource keys match the service
keys (`subnets`, `security_groups`, `route_tables`, `internet_gateways`,
`nat_gateways`, `endpoints`, `network_acls`, `peering`, `flow_logs`,
`ec2_instances`, `lambda`, `rds`, `load_balancers`).

```yaml
display:
  vpc:
    subnets:
      columns: [name, cidr, az, available_ips, public]   # table columns, left→right
      detail:  [subnet_id, vpc_id, state, map_public_ip] # fields in the detail overlay
    security_groups:
      columns: [sg_id, name, inbound, outbound, description]
```

Any resource type you omit keeps its built-in defaults.

## Authentication

Five methods are supported, configured via `authMethod` in `config.yaml` or `--auth-method` on the CLI:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `auto` | AWS SDK default chain: env vars → `~/.aws` credentials/config → EC2/ECS instance metadata |
| `profile` | Named profile from `~/.aws/credentials` or `~/.aws/config` |
| `env` | Only `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables |
| `static` | Plaintext credentials in `config.yaml` under `aws.static` (avoid committing real keys) |
| `sts` | Assume an IAM role via STS; base credentials come from profile/env/default chain |

### STS AssumeRole Example

```yaml
aws:
  authMethod: sts
  sts:
    roleArn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ReadOnlyRole
    sessionName: aws-explorer
    externalId: my-external-id    # if required by the trust policy
    durationSeconds: 3600
```

Or via CLI flag:

```bash
./bin/aws_explorer --auth-method sts --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ReadOnlyRole
```

## Supported Services

| Service Key | Resources Collected | Scope |
|-------------|--------------------|----|
| `ec2` | Instances, VPCs | Regional |
| `s3` | Buckets | Global |
| `rds` | DB instances | Regional |
| `iam` | Roles, users, policies, groups | Global |
| `dynamodb` | Tables | Regional |
| `lambda` | Functions | Regional |
| `emr` | Clusters | Regional |
| `ecs` | Clusters, services | Regional |
| `eks` | Clusters | Regional |
| `elbv2` | Load balancers | Regional |
| `secretsmanager` | Secrets | Regional |
| `sqs` | Queues | Regional |
| `sns` | Topics | Regional |
| `cloudwatch` | Alarms | Regional |
| `route53` | Hosted zones | Global |

Global services (S3, IAM, Route53) are collected once regardless of the regions list.

## Themes

The TUI supports 12 built-in color themes, all named after Australian birds.
Their colors come straight from the [feathers](https://github.com/shandiya/feathers)
palettes (the same data rendered at
[ryandam.net/demos/feathers_palettes](https://ryandam.net/demos/feathers_palettes/index.html)).
Set the active theme in `config.yaml` under `ui.theme` or with the `--theme`
flag on the S3 subcommand.

| Theme Name | Palette feel |
|------------|--------------|
| `spotted-pardalote` | Warm yellow, orange and red |
| `plains-wanderer` | Cream, tan and golden brown |
| `bee-eater` | Cyan, blue and amber |
| `rose-crowned-fruit-dove` | Magenta, coral and green |
| `eastern-rosella` | Yellow, lime and red |
| `oriole` | Gold, salmon and lavender |
| `princess-parrot` | Green, blue and pink (default) |
| `superb-fairy-wren` | Rust, tan and cream |
| `cassowary` | Teal, gold and pink |
| `yellow-robin` | Bright yellow, slate and amber |
| `galah` | Pink, blush and slate |
| `blue-winged-kookaburra` | Light cyan, teal and orange |

### Color roles

Each theme configures granular color roles so that changing one part of the UI
never bleeds into another. Set only the roles you want to change — any role you
leave out falls back to a sensible related role (noted below).

**General**

| Role | Used for | Fallback |
|------|----------|----------|
| `heading` | Titles and section headers | — |
| `text` | Body / foreground text | — |
| `background` | Panel backgrounds (empty = terminal default) | — |
| `muted` | De-emphasised / secondary text | — |
| `accent` | Decorative rails, input prompts and cursors | `heading` |
| `border` | Borders of unfocused panels | — |
| `borderFocus` | Border of the focused panel | `heading` |
| `highlight` | Selected item background (lists, menus) | — |
| `highlightText` | Text on the selected item | — |

**Tables** (every table in the app shares these, so all tables look identical)

| Role | Used for | Fallback |
|------|----------|----------|
| `tableHeader` | Table column header text | `muted` |
| `tableHeaderBg` | Table column header background | `background` |
| `tableHeaderLine` | Rule drawn under table headers | `border` |
| `tableText` | Table cell text | `text` |
| `tableBorder` | Border drawn around table panels | `border` |
| `tableSelectedBg` | Selected table-row background | `highlight` |
| `tableSelectedText` | Text on the selected table row | `highlightText` |

**Status bar & shortcut hints**

| Role | Used for | Fallback |
|------|----------|----------|
| `statusBarBg` | Status bar background | `highlight` |
| `statusBarText` | Status bar text | `highlightText` |
| `hintKey` | Shortcut keys (e.g. `Enter`) in the status bar hints | `statusBarText` |
| `hintText` | Shortcut descriptions (e.g. *open*) in the hints | `statusBarText` |

**Alerts**

| Role | Used for | Fallback |
|------|----------|----------|
| `error` | Error messages and indicators | — |
| `warning` | Warning messages and indicators | — |
| `success` | Success / confirmation messages (e.g. *reachable*, *no issues*) | `accent` |
| `info` | Informational messages and indicators | `muted` |

(The authoritative list lives in the `Roles` registry in
`internal/ui/theme.go`; role names in `config.yaml` are matched
case-insensitively.)

Override any role in `config.yaml` — for example, to recolor just the table
header of the `oriole` theme without touching anything else:

```yaml
ui:
  theme: oriole
  themes:
    oriole:
      tableHeader: "#34E0A1"   # only the table header changes
      error: "#FF0000"         # override just this role
```

The in-app settings panel (press `S`) lets you edit every role live and saves
your changes back to `config.yaml`.

VPC TUI (bubbletea) ──┐
                      ├── Auth (5 methods) ──── EC2 / VPC, RDS, Lambda, ELBv2 APIs
S3 TUI (bubbletea) ───┘                          S3 API
```

The CLI and main TUI share the **`Engine`**, which orchestrates concurrent collection via a bounded goroutine pool, running each `(service, region)` pair in parallel. Global services run once. Results stream back incrementally via a channel so the CLI can print and the TUI can render as data arrives.

The **VPC Explorer** and **S3** TUIs are standalone: they build credentials through the same auth layer but call the relevant AWS APIs directly rather than going through the collector engine.

Each service collector implements:

```go
type Collector interface {
    Name()     string
    IsGlobal() bool
    Collect(ctx context.Context, input CollectInput) ([]model.Resource, error)
}
```

Adding a new AWS service requires only a new package under `internal/services/` that implements this interface, plus registering it in `internal/services/registry.go`.
